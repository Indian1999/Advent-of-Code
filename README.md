Advent of Code 2024 journal

Day 1:
Not much to say, was an easy routine task.

Day 10:
This was a nice challange, needed to think it through to get a fairly easy solution, altough it helped that I accidentally solved part2 while trying to solve part1 :D

Day 11:
I almost pulled my hair out over this one. Part 1 was easily done with the brute force method, just split the stones 25 times. When it came to part 2 I was surprised to see it only asks me what happens if we blink 75 times. I was like, so I will just replace a 25 with 75 and we are done. Yeeeee, nope. First I tried to find a faster way of calculating the end result, took me a decent amount of time to figure it out. In the process I decided to switch to cpp from python to help with the runtime. It was a good choice in some ways, bad in others. The end code would probably work fine in python as well but would have been much easier to write.
But since I did it in cpp, I had to learn a lot of new things. I used unordered_maps for the first time, I had to figure out how to hash a pair of integers and I also ran into the problem of integer overflowing which I had to solve.
Overall, I probably made it unnecessarily hard, but it was a really good learning experience.
